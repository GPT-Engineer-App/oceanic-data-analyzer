# oceanic-data-analyzer

I want to build a data analysis web browser for my startup DataWiki. The web browser will have a small paragraph describing my startup, and on a separate page will have a space to enter or upload data as a file (any type of file) along with a drop down menu for different data analysis operations to be carried out. Have an oceanic blue color scheme along with 3d imagery of different data visualizations. The web browser should be interactive
